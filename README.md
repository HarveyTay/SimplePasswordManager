# Simple Password Manager

---
I set out to do this to keep pursuing my knowledge of cpp and stay uptodate about the basics of cpp file I/O and string manipulation this also allows me to go more indepth with learning about different types of encryption like xor and the library's that I will try to implement such as openssl and crypto++ and how they could be used in a practical sense


## To Do:
Add encryption

make gui

~~change database type(csv/db)~~

create password generator
