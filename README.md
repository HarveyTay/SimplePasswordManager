# Simple Password Manager

---
I set out to do this to keep pursuing my knowledge of cpp and stay up-to-date about the basics of cpp file I/O and string manipulation this also allows me to go more indepth with learning about different types of encryption like xor and the library's that I will try to implement such as openssl and crypto++ and how they could be used in a practical sense

## What I Learned From This Project

I Solidified my knowledge of functions used in C++ and got more comfortable with .h and .cpp header files.

I also Further improved my knowledge of basic file I/O which is one of the things i originally set out to do in this project.

Another thing I knew about C++ was the memory management and steps for efficiency, but I have never played around with before but with this project I hope to scratch the surface by how I have already used some memory efficiency with ```std::string&``` and as my program isn't passing big strings and doing complicated things this doesn't really have a big impact but still gets me into the habit of efficiency coding.

## To Do:
~~Add encryption (Xor)~~

Upgrade Encryption

make gui

~~change database type(csv/db)~~

create password generator
